strings are immutable by default, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed. However, there's no direct concept of a mutable string in Java's standard library.

But we can achieve similar functionality using StringBuilder or StringBuffer classes. These classes provide methods to modify the contents of the string they hold.

Example:-
public class MutableStringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder mutableString = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        
        System.out.println("Original String: " + mutableString);

        mutableString.append(" World");
        System.out.println("Appended String: " + mutableString);
        
        mutableString.insert(5, ", Java");
        System.out.println("Modified String: " + mutableString);
        
        mutableString.delete(5, 10);
        System.out.println("Deleted String: " + mutableString);
    }
}
Output:

Original String: Hello
Appended String: Hello World
Modified String: Hello, Java World
Deleted String: HelloWorld
